    -going through and copying things that I had done before on my 581 server
        + Copied a lot of the vcu118 implemnetation:
            fpga-shells/src/main/scala/xilinx/xilinxzcu106mig
            fpga-shells/src/main/scala/ip/zcu106
            fpga-shells/src/main/scala/shell/xilinx/ZCU106ShellNew
            src/main/resources/zcu106
            fpga-shells/xilinx/zcu106
        + And any files I was missing in fpga/src/main/scala/zcu106
    -Need to go through these files with a fine toothed comb now, everything compiles with the VCU118 stuff
        + Going through ZCU106ShellNew first, since that is the base layer from the SiFive UltraScaleShell
            Comparing ZCU106 and VCU118 Pin mappings to translate
